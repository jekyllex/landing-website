# Privacy Policy
Gourav Khunger built the JekyllEx app as a Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) app.
This SERVICE is provided by Gourav Khunger at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding the policies with respect to privacy and data
handling if anyone decided to use this Service.

JekyllEx is committed to protecting your privacy. As a FLOSS application, we do not collect,
store, or share any personally identifiable information. All data processing occurs locally
on your device.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions,
which is accessible at JekyllEx unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

JekyllEx does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.
All data and content you work with in the app remains entirely on your device.

As a FLOSS application, JekyllEx operates without any third-party tracking services,
analytics, or data collection mechanisms.

## Log Data

JekyllEx does not collect any log data or crash reports. Any errors or logs that may occur
remain entirely on your device and are not transmitted to any external services.

## Cookies

JekyllEx does not use cookies or any tracking mechanisms. As a FLOSS application,
it operates without any data collection or tracking functionality.

## Service Providers

JekyllEx does not employ any third-party services that have access to user data.
As a FLOSS application, all functionality is self-contained and does not rely on
external services for data processing or analytics.

The integration with GitHub through personal access tokens is solely for
interacting with your GitHub repositories. This access is managed entirely by you,
and no data is shared with JekyllEx or any third-party services.

The app does not depend on a backend. The tokens never leave your device.

## Security

Since JekyllEx does not collect or transmit any personal information, traditional security
concerns related to data transmission and storage do not apply. All your data remains
securely on your device under your control.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be
directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.
Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies,
or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

JekyllEx is safe for users of all ages as it does not collect any personally identifiable
information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age. All data remains
locally on the user's device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
on this page.

This policy is effective as of **29 June, 2025**. The first draft was created on **26 August, 2021**.
